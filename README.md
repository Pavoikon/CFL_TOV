# CFL_TOV
Tolman-Volkoff-Oppenheimer solver for CFL Quark Stars

A python code that utilises the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to solve the TOV equations for Colour-Flavour-Locked (CFL) Quark Stars.
The applied Equation of State is acquired from [PhysRevD.108.063010](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063010)
